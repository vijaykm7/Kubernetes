Kubernetes installation steps.

Two way availabe for setting up kuberntes 
1. minikube -- learning env]
2. kubeadm  -- Prod env (recomended)

Linux Machine Pre-Requistes 
  * A compatible Linux host. The Kubernetes project provides generic instructions for Linux distributions based on Debian and Red Hat, and those distributions without a package manager.
  * 2 GB or more of RAM per machine (any less will leave little room for your apps). 
  * 2 CPUs or more.
  * Full network connectivity between all machines in the cluster (public or private network is fine).
  * Unique hostname, MAC address, and product_uuid for every node. See here for more details.
  * Certain ports are open on your machines. See here for more details.
  * Swap disabled. You MUST disable swap in order for the kubelet to work properly

Note : docker should be installe , Up and runnign.


step 1)
  Allow 6443 over firewall to communicate
  #firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=6443/tcp

step 2) 
 disable selinux
 setenforce 0 
 sed -i --follow-symlinks 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/g' /etc/sysconfig/selinux 
 
step 3)
 run the command to Enable br_netfilter Kernel Module
 #modprobe br_netfilter
 

 step 4)
 Bypas Iptables
  #echo '1' > /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-iptables
  #sysctl --system
  
Step 5) 
Disable SWAP
 run the command #swapoff -a
 open vi /etc/fstab and commnt anything related to 'swap'
 
 
 step 6)
 Install Kuberntes.
 You will install these packages on all of your machines:

  * kubeadm: the command to bootstrap the cluster.

  * kubelet: the component that runs on all of the machines in your cluster and does things like starting pods and containers.

  * kubectl: the command line util to talk to your cluster.
